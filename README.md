# InputDiscriminator
Input Data Discriminator for Model Choice and Learning

The idea behind this is to create a model that can take any input data and learn how to classify it and determine what sub model it should be passed to. Basically a quick filter to determine what part of the architecture gets to try out the predictions. 

This was put together on a weekend just to get the code out that slightly resembles the idea.  Will clean it and shorten it. I'm also learning as I go so it will change alot.  The code here barely resembles the idea.
